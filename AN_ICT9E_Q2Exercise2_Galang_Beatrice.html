	When you were here, the stars disappear<br>
	Nothing can outshine the dress that you wear<br>
	We should be dancing 'cause girl you look stunning<br>
	Let's spend the night together 'till reach the morning<br>
	<br>
	Up and above, never enough<br>
	I wanna hold your hand and show what is love<br>
	When you are smiling and when you are laughing<br>
	We should keep dancing to treasure the feelings<br>
	<br>
	Like it's the old love (it's the old love)<br>
	This is the way that we both wanna feel<br>
	Under the moonlight we made our first kiss<br>
	'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel<br>
	<br>
	Like it's the old love (it's the old love)<br>
	Come on and hold me, I want you right here<br>
	Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear<br>
	I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here<br>
	<br>
	When I'm with you, it's like déjà vu<br>
	I realize that dreams really come true<br>
	We keep on talking for the moment we live in<br>
	Let's keep drinking 'till the moon disappear<br>
	<br>
	You are the one, the one that I want<br>
	The one that will stay by my side till I'm gone<br>
	The love of my life and I'll sacrifice<br>
	Just for the moment we last long forever<br>
	<br>
	Like it's the old love (it's the old love)<br>
	This is the way that we both wanna feel<br>
	Under the moonlight we made our first kiss<br>
	'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel<br>
	<br>
	Like it's the old love<br>
	Come on and hold me, I want you right here<br>
	Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear<br>
	I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here<br>
	Like it's the old love<br>
	<br>
	It's the old love<br>
	This is the way that we both wanna feel<br>
	Under the moonlight we made our first kiss<br>
	'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel<br>
	Like it's the old love<br>
